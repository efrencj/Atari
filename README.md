# Atari
# Introduction

Some time ago, I worked on this **Atari Breakout** project as part of a team. It was a great opportunity to apply **object-oriented programming** in JavaScript while collaborating with others to build a functional game.

## Challenges & Learning Experience

One of the most complex aspects of the project was calculating the **angle at which the ball would bounce** upon hitting the paddle. This required a deep understanding of collision detection and physics in a 2D environment.

Despite the challenges, I learned a lot from this experienceâ€”both in terms of JavaScript and teamwork. It helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills and gave me a better grasp of game mechanics and object-oriented programming concepts.

## Conclusion

Looking back, this project was a valuable learning experience that contributed to my growth as a developer. It reinforced my interest in game development and showed me the importance of **precision in coding physics-based interactions**.  
Even though some time has passed since I completed it, I still appreciate the lessons it taught me.
